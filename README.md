SimpleInstantMessenger
======================

A simple instant messenger using basic Networking and GUI principals in Java. Used as a learning experience!
This is a basic "skeleton" of what I hope to create in the future. Right now, the program has these functionalities:
  -Two different computers can chat with each other in an Instant Messenger-like way.
  -You can test the application on your own computer and just run both the Server and Client.
  -The IM windows each have their own name: One is the Server, one is the Client
  
NOTE:  It doesn't matter if you are using one computer or two different computers, you must run the Server first, and then run the Client so that the Client can connect to the server after the server is established. 

Additionally, if you need to change the IP address being used with the Client based on what the IP address of your computer is.
